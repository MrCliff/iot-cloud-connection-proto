# IoT cloud connection prototype

This project is a prototype for testing connection to different
popular PaaS cloud services. The prototype collects data from some
simple sensors and sends the data periodically to four cloud services
using their IoT features. The cloud services are *Amazon AWS*,
*Microsoft Azure*, *Google Cloud* and *IBM Watson*.

This prototype is part of my Master's thesis.
